    <h1>These are my favorite places to...</h1>
    <h2>Eat!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Vesta (East Rutherford, NJ)</em> - Amazing gourmet personal <em>pizza</em>!</li>
      <li><em>Hiro Sushi (Lyndhurst, NJ)</em> - <i>Who</i> doesn't love some great sushi?</li>
      <li><em>Villa Mannino's (Bordentown, NJ)</em> - The best pasta fagiola and great Italian dishes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Okay, enough of food. Now I'm hungry. But let's go onto my favorite small towns...</p>

    <h2>Stroll (Small Towns)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Princeton, NJ</em> - Intellectual college town with world-class food and beautiful shops!</li>
      <li><em>New Hope, PA / Lambertville, NJ</em> - Straddling the Deleware river about 30 minutes
       north of Trenton, NJ lie these two quaint-but-eccentric towns. Be sure to grab a drink
       at one of the many bars or restaurants and catch some live music.</li>
      <li><em>Bordentown City, NJ</em> - Okay, this is a homer pick obviously, but a great small town to
         enjoy a nice dinner, have a craft brew, or stop in one of the many unique craft shops.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After eating and taking a stroll through one of the towns, onto my favorite places to...</p>

    <h2>Beach it!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Belmar, NJ</em> - gets a bad rap sometimes because of the "guidos" and "bennies", but it's a
        short(er) drive from most places in the state and boasts a nice boardwalk and solid eats on
        the main drag</li>
      <li><em>West Coast, FL</em></li> - Okay so not a single place, but the west coast of Florida has some great
      beaches and great weather. Beaching it is great because the water is always warm and calm.</li>
      <li><em>Long Beach, NJ</em> - Big beaches with mixed-use nearby for planty of options for dining, drinks, or
        shopping. Parking can be tough and be prepared to pay for it.</li>
    </ul>
